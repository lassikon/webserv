1. Syntax Errors
done - Missing Brackets or Delimiters: Ensure that the configuration file contains all necessary {}, [], or = symbols, and that they are properly balanced.
on going - Malformed Key-Value Pairs: Check that each key has an associated value and that they are correctly separated by = or : depending on your format.
2. Type Errors
Incorrect Data Types: Validate that values are of the expected type (e.g., port should be an integer, host should be a valid IP address or domain name).
Invalid Numeric Ranges: Ensure numerical values like port, client_body_size_limit, or timeout are within acceptable ranges (e.g., port should be between 1 and 65535).
3. Missing or Duplicate Required Fields
Missing Required Fields: Check that all mandatory fields like host, port, and server_name are present in each server block.
Duplicate Keys: Ensure that no key is defined more than once within the same block (unless your format allows lists, in which case you handle it appropriately).
4. Logical Errors
Conflicting or Overlapping Server Configurations:
Duplicate Ports: Ensure that no two servers listen on the same port unless they are differentiated by server_name.
Conflicting Server Names: If server_name is specified, ensure they are unique per host
pair.
Invalid Paths: Validate file and directory paths (e.g., root paths, error page paths) to ensure they exist and have the proper permissions.
Invalid HTTP Methods: Ensure that specified HTTP methods in route blocks (e.g., GET, POST) are valid and recognized.
5. Semantic Errors
Invalid Redirection: If a route specifies a redirection, ensure that the target URL is correctly formed.
CGI Configuration: If using CGI, verify that executable paths are correct and that the required interpreter is available.
Directory Listing Conflicts: Ensure that directory listing settings do not conflict with other routing settings.
6. Size Limits and Quotas
Client Body Size Limit: Verify that the client_body_size_limit is not set to a value that is too small to be functional or so large that it could impact performance or security.
7. Environment-Specific Issues
Port Availability: Ensure the configured port is available and not in use by another process.
Permissions: Verify that the server has the required permissions to read configuration files, access directories, and execute CGI scripts.
8. Redundancy and Fallbacks
Default Server for Host:Port: If multiple servers are configured for the same host and port, ensure that there is a default server configuration for unmatched requests.
Default Error Pages: Ensure that default error pages are configured or that the server gracefully handles missing error pages.
9. EOF and Parsing Continuity
Unexpected EOF: Handle cases where the file ends unexpectedly, particularly if a block (e.g., server {}) is not closed properly.
10. General Exception Handling
File Access Issues: Handle errors when the configuration file cannot be opened, read, or parsed.
Overflow or Underflow: Detect and handle any potential overflow or underflow in numerical values during parsing.
Implementation Tip:
Ensure that your parsing logic is modular, allowing you to validate each part of the configuration file independently. Implement detailed error messages to help identify and resolve issues quickly.

Syntax Errors:

Basic Syntax: NGINX ensures that the configuration file follows correct syntax rules, including properly closed braces ({}), semicolons at the end of directives, and correct use of quotation marks.
Directive Placement: Directives must be placed in appropriate contexts (e.g., listen directives inside a server block). NGINX checks that each directive is used in the correct context.
Correct Directives:

Valid Directives: NGINX ensures that all directives used in the configuration are valid and recognized.
Argument Count: The number of arguments for each directive is checked against what NGINX expects.
Duplicate Directives:

Conflicting or Duplicate Directives: NGINX looks for duplicate or conflicting directives within the same context (e.g., multiple listen directives that could conflict).
Logical Errors:

Port and IP Address Conflicts: NGINX checks for potential conflicts, such as multiple servers trying to listen on the same IP address and port combination.
Server Name Conflicts: If multiple server blocks have the same server_name, NGINX ensures that these are handled correctly.
Missing or Invalid Files:

File Paths: NGINX verifies that files and directories specified (such as error pages, SSL certificates, etc.) exist and are accessible.
Include Files: NGINX checks that any included configuration files are present and valid.
Type Validation:

Integer Validation: NGINX ensures that integer values, such as worker_processes or client_max_body_size, are properly set and valid.
Boolean Validation: Directives that expect boolean values (e.g., on or off) are validated.
Contextual Validation:

Correct Contexts: NGINX checks if directives are used in the right context (e.g., location blocks within server blocks).
Correct Nesting: Proper nesting of blocks, such as location within server, is validated.
Unused or Unknown Parameters:

Unused Parameters: NGINX identifies directives or parameters that are declared but not used.
Unknown Parameters: If a directive takes an argument, NGINX checks if it is recognized and valid.
Module-Specific Checks:

Module Dependencies: NGINX ensures that modules needed for certain directives (e.g., SSL, HTTP, Gzip) are present and correctly loaded.


1. Syntax Errors
Incorrect Brackets: Missing or mismatched {} brackets.
Incorrect Semicolons: Missing or extra semicolons. For example, each directive must end with a semicolon (;).
Invalid Directives: Using directives that don't exist or are misspelled.
Unknown Parameters: Incorrect parameters for directives, such as invalid options for a known directive.
2. Duplicate or Conflicting Configuration
Duplicate server_name within the Same server Block: Having the same server_name declared more than once within the same server block.
Multiple listen Directives with Conflicts: For example, specifying the same IP and port in different server blocks without distinguishing them (e.g., by server_name or other factors).
Conflicting Location Blocks: Overlapping or conflicting location blocks without clear hierarchy or ordering.
3. Invalid or Incomplete Paths
Invalid File Paths: Specifying a path for root, include, error_page, etc., that does not exist.
Invalid Log File Paths: Specifying a path to log files (like access_log or error_log) that is inaccessible or does not exist.
4. Port and Address Issues
Invalid Port Numbers: Using port numbers outside the valid range (1-65535).
Port Already in Use: Attempting to bind to a port that is already in use by another application.
5. Permission Issues
Insufficient Permissions: NGINX does not have sufficient permissions to read the files or directories specified in the configuration (e.g., for root, ssl_certificate, etc.).
Access Log or Error Log Permissions: NGINX 

will usually log an error and refuse to start.
Redundant or Conflicting Configurations:

NGINX may silently override conflicting configurations within the same context. For example, if multiple root directives are specified in the same location block, the last one defined will take precedence, and the others are effectively ignored without causing an error.
Out-of-Order Directives:

If directives are placed in the wrong context (e.g., a location block inside another location block), NGINX will usually produce an error and refuse to start.
Invalid Syntax in Directives:

If a directive has incorrect syntax but is still valid (e.g., missing a semicolon), NGINX will produce a syntax error and refuse to start.
Warnings:

Some non-fatal issues might trigger warnings instead of errors. NGINX will log these warnings but may still start successfully.
Unconfigured or Misconfigured Error Pages:

If an error page is configured incorrectly or is missing, NGINX might still serve a generic error page, depending on the situation.


When to Use Exceptions
Critical Errors:

Use exceptions for critical errors that make it impossible to continue processing, such as:
Missing mandatory sections (like [server] block).
Invalid syntax that cannot be interpreted (e.g., missing = in key-value pairs).
Unexpected end of the file when more data is expected.
Invalid Values:

Throw exceptions for values that don’t make sense or are out of an acceptable range (e.g., a negative port number).
Unrecoverable Errors:

If your program cannot continue safely after an error, exceptions are suitable. For example, if a key that must be present in every section is missing.
When Not to Use Exceptions
Non-Critical Errors:

For errors that can be safely handled or ignored (e.g., optional sections or parameters), avoid using exceptions. Instead, use default values, log a warning, or simply skip the invalid data.
Control Flow:

Do not use exceptions for normal control flow, such as checking if a section exists. Exceptions should only be used for truly exceptional situations.
Performance Critical Sections:

If performance is critical, excessive use of exceptions can be costly, as they involve stack unwinding and may be slower than traditional error handling methods.
Strategy for Parsing Configuration Files
Validation Functions: Use separate validation functions to check the integrity of the parsed data before or after populating the configuration. This allows you to handle errors more flexibly.

Error Reporting: Where appropriate, return error codes or status indicators instead of throwing exceptions. This can make your code more predictable and easier to debug.

Granular Exception Handling: Catch exceptions as close as possible to where they are thrown to ensure the rest of the parsing process isn’t affected unnecessarily.
